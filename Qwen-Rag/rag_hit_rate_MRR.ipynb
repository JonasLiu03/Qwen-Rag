      "- What does the model do with the sequence of previous interactions?\n",
      "- The model processes a sequence of previous interactions to generate an embedding for the next item. Specifically, it takes a sequence of previous interactions \\( U = \\{I_1, I_2, \\ldots, I_n\\} \\) in chronological order and uses them to predict the next item \\( I_{n+1} \\). This involves several steps including embedding the time information related to these interactions and then merging this information to produce a final embedding that represents the next item. The process is designed to be more efficient and effective compared to traditional LLMs that handle text inputs and outputs in a token-by-token manner. The embedding of the next item, denoted as \\( E'_i \\), is expected to capture the essence of the upcoming interaction based on the historical sequence provided.\n",
      "- The code snippet you provided illustrates part of this process, where `time_emb` is concatenated along the last dimension and then passed through a `merge_time` function to obtain the final embedding for the next item. This embedding is intended to reflect the contextual information from the sequence of past interactions, aiding in the prediction of the next item in the sequence.\n",
      "- In summary, the model leverages the sequence of previous interactions to predict the next item by generating an appropriate embedding that encapsulates the relevant contextual information from the history. This approach aims to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the recommendation system.\n",

The current model described seems to be an attempt to address some of the limitations of traditional LLMs in handling sequential data efficiently.\n",
